Hello I'm Paul and i like food. My first recipe is a dish that you can eat. There will be ingredients of food articles :)

## 

# recipe 1: sugar in a cup

## step 1

roll the **dice** on how much sugar you *want*.

```{r}
dice <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
amount_of_sugar <- sample(dice, 1)
```

## step 2

You need to put {{amount_of_sugar}} grams in a cup.

# **step 3** 

Then add some water :)
